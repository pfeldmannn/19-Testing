# 19-Testing

### Description
I enhanced a Tech Quiz application by adding component and end-to-end testing. The application was buiilt using the MERN stack with a React front-end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It enables users to take a multiple choice quiz of ten random questions fetched from the API. At the end of the quiz users are displayed with their score and the option to take another quiz.

### Usage 
Here is a walkthrough video on how to use this application.
